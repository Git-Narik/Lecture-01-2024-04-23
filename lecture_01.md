> It was found in 1989 in CERN by Tim Bernerslee to share research documents and later was released for public usage.

> It works through a set of protocols to access internet.

Some of them are as follows.

1. IP - Internet Protocol

	IP address is unique to each computer and is reference to that computer in each communication and information sharing.

2. TCP - Transmission Control Protocol


3. **HTTP**

	It is abbreviation for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

	It is a protocol for transfer of information among computers in internet.

**Browser**

It is a software to access internet through world wide web.

It runs on your computer.



**Search Engine**

It is a software running somewhere to search your input or requirement.



- Browser asks search engine for information and search engine gets information from server.


- The whole thing runs on client server model wherein client sends request and server sends information, if available.


**Status Code**

It is the response to the input or request we send into the internet.

There are some numbers assgined for different types of reponses from server.

Some are as follows.

- numbers in 200 range indicate success or correct as per TCP

- numbers in 400 range indicate something wrong from client as in prompt does not have output or they are not authorised for such information etc.,

	404 - incorrect prompt

	401 - unauthorised for information

- numbers in 500 range indicate there are server issues

	501 - server is down
